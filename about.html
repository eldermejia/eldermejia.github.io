 Hi, I’m Elder Mejia, and I’m a freshman at the University at Buffalo studying Computer Science
 and Engineering. I’m from Brentwood New York on Long Island.
 I’ve still haven’t done much work with computer science or any programming.  I have taken a small
 class in high school where I began my interest in programming.
 I have designed and made this website for myself, and this is just the beginning.
 In the past, I’ve been trying to teach myself the basics of programming and computers.
 Now I have some knowledge in java, html, and css.
 When I grow up, I want to be able to code my own applications and work for a large company
 like Google. This personal website is an aggregator for all my future work and
 all the future press about me. I’m passionate about learning new things and solving puzzles.
 It peaks my interest when I’m able to do things first hand, and making them work out.
 For example, programming, when you are able to write code and then run it and it works.
 It’s just an amazing feeling.
